MoneyBot is a fun-and-games bot developed for Discord Hackweek.
Although it's mainly for entertainment, it also has a very useful translation feature that utilizes Google Translate API.

Unfortunately, I've yet to figure out how to get the translation feature working on a server as it requires a powershell command to be run at each session initiation.
If you know how to do that, let me know!
All other commands work with the server software.

This bot is hosted with Heroku.

If you'd like to  give the bot a try, join this server:
(If you would like to use the translation feature, ping me and I will do it ASAP.)
